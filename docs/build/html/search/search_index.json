To bring up the development environment, you'll first need to ensure all of the required environment variables are exported into your shell session. From there, you can just docker-compose up -d For development, the docker container will just run a sleep command to keep the container running, you can then shell in to the container with docker exec -it nhsx_web_1 fish or docker exec -it nhsx_web_1 zsh depending on your preferred shell.
